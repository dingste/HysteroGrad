\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We introduce HysteroGrad, a novel optimization framework that treats neural network parameter spaces as physical manifolds subject to work-hardening and phase transitions. By integrating the Fisher Information Metric with a dynamic hysteresis barrier, we define a "Schmitt-Trigger" update rule. This mechanism allows for rapid "liquid" convergence in high-curvature regions while enforcing a "frozen" stability as the model accumulates information distance ($\tau$). We demonstrate that this approach significantly improves the Accuracy per TFLOP (ATF) on consumer-grade hardware.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Current gradient-based optimization methods (e.g., Adam, SGD) operate primarily in Euclidean space, often ignoring the underlying probability manifold. HysteroGrad bridges the gap between \textbf{Information Geometry} and \textbf{Physical Systems Theory}. We postulate that information accumulation in a neural network is analogous to a path functional in a dissipative physical system.

\section{The Mathematical Framework}

\subsection{The Riemannian Metric Tensor}
We define the parameter space as a Riemannian manifold $\mathcal{M}$ equipped with the Fisher Information Metric $G(\theta)$. In our implementation, we utilize a diagonal approximation:
\begin{equation}
G(\theta) = \mathbb{E} [\nabla_\theta \log p(x|\theta) \nabla_\theta \log p(x|\theta)^T]
\end{equation}
The metric $G$ ensures that updates $\Delta \theta$ are invariant to reparameterization, following the \textit{Natural Gradient}.
In practice, we employ the empirical Fisher induced by the training loss rather than the true model Fisher.


\subsection{Information Path Length (Internal Time $\tau$)}
We define the scalar path functional $\tau$ as the accumulated geodesic distance traveled by the system:
\begin{equation}
\tau(t) = \int_{0}^{t} \sqrt{\left(\frac{d\theta}{ds}\right)^T G(\theta) \left(\frac{d\theta}{ds}\right)} ds
\end{equation}
In discrete training, $\tau$ is accumulated per parameter group using the diagonal metric and the applied update magnitude.
In the discrete-time implementation, this represents the "Internal Time" or the cumulative information depth of the model.

\subsection{Dynamic Hysteresis and the Stiffening Functional}
Inspired by the physical phenomenon of \textit{work hardening}, we introduce a stiffening functional $f(\tau)$. This functional acts as a non-linear energy barrier (Hysteresis Width):
\begin{equation}
f(\tau, T) = \kappa \cdot \sqrt{\tau} \cdot (1 - T)
\end{equation}
where $\kappa$ is the stiffening factor and $T$ is the geometric temperature (annealing).
$T \in [0,1]$ denotes a monotonically annealed geometric temperature controlling the effective barrier height.

\subsection{Extended Stiffening Functional}
To account for local volatility, the hysteresis barrier is dynamically scaled by the system's average kinetic energy $E$: \begin{equation} f(\tau, T, \mathcal{E}) = \kappa \cdot \sqrt{\tau} \cdot (1 - T) \cdot \mathcal{E} \end{equation} where $E$ is an exponential moving average of the preconditioned gradient norm. This ensures that the barrier remains permeable during high-velocity transitions while hardening rapidly in low-signal regimes.

\section{The HysteroGrad Update Rule}
The transition between the \textbf{Liquid Phase} and the \textbf{Frozen Phase} is governed by a Schmitt-Trigger condition. The update $\Delta \theta$ is non-zero only if the norm of the Natural Gradient exceeds the current hysteresis barrier:
The norm is computed as the RMS norm of the preconditioned gradient.

\begin{equation}
\Delta \theta_{t+1} = 
\begin{cases} 
-\eta G^{-1} \nabla \mathcal{L}(\theta_t) & \text{if } \| G^{-1} \nabla \mathcal{L}(\theta_t) \| > f(\tau_t) \\
0 & \text{otherwise (Frozen State)}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\section{Information-Geometric Implications}
HysteroGrad naturally addresses the "Endless Zooming" problem in flat minima. As $\tau$ increases, the barrier filters out stochastic noise, effectively providing an \textbf{automated, physics-based early stopping mechanism} per parameter group.

\section{Experimental Evaluation}

\subsection{Metric: Accuracy Per TFLOP (ATF)}
To evaluate the efficiency of HysteroGrad on compute-constrained consumer hardware, we introduce the \textit{Accuracy Per TFLOP} (ATF) metric. This quantifies the generalization capability $A$ (test accuracy) relative to the cumulative floating-point operations $C$ in TeraFLOPs:
\begin{equation}
\text{ATF} = \frac{A(\%)}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} C_i}
\end{equation}
where $n$ is the number of training steps. This metric is critical for assessing the "Energy-to-Information" conversion rate of an optimizer.

\subsection{Benchmark: WideResNet-28-2 on CIFAR-10}
We compared HysteroGrad against a tuned AdamW baseline ($lr=1e-3, \beta=(0.9, 0.999)$). Both models utilized a WideResNet-28-2 architecture. 
All optimizers were evaluated under identical architectural, data, and FLOP constraints.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Early-Stage Efficiency:} HysteroGrad demonstrated a "Geometric Ignition" phase. While initial accuracy was lower due to metric stabilization, Epoch 3 showed a non-linear surge in performance (+21\% accuracy).
    \item \textbf{Peak ATF:} HysteroGrad achieved a peak ATF of $0.60 \%/\text{TFLOP}$ in the first epoch, maintaining a significantly higher efficiency slope than the baseline as training progressed.
    \item \textbf{Final Accuracy:} After 4 epochs, HysteroGrad reached $72.76\%$ test accuracy, outperforming the baseline under identical FLOP constraints by 3.37\%.
\end{itemize}

We emphasize that ATF, rather than raw accuracy at fixed epochs, is the primary evaluation metric, as it reflects optimization efficiency under fixed compute budgets.

Accuracy and hysteresis evolution as a function of cumulative PFLOPs on CIFAR-10 using WideResNet-28-2.
While AdamW exhibits higher early-stage accuracy, HysteroGrad maintains a significantly higher Accuracy per TFLOP (ATF) during the initial compute budget and demonstrates a delayed nonlinear accuracy surge ("Geometric Ignition") once the hysteresis width stabilizes.
The monotonic growth of the hysteresis barrier reflects irreversible information accumulation, enabling compute-efficient generalization under constrained FLOP budgets.

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:atf_ignition} highlights that HysteroGrad should not be evaluated solely by early-epoch accuracy.
Although AdamW achieves higher test accuracy during the first training epoch, HysteroGrad exhibits a substantially higher Accuracy per TFLOP (ATF), indicating a more efficient conversion of compute into generalization.
This behavior is critical in compute-constrained regimes, where optimization efficiency dominates asymptotic performance.

As training progresses, HysteroGrad undergoes a distinct non-linear transition.
Once the accumulated information path length induces sufficient hysteresis stiffening, accuracy increases rapidly without a proportional increase in compute.
This phenomenon, referred to as \emph{Geometric Ignition}, is absent in AdamW, which lacks an internal, history-dependent barrier mechanism.
The result is a smoother but less compute-efficient convergence trajectory.

Importantly, the observed accuracy surge coincides with the stabilization of the hysteresis width rather than changes in learning rate or gradient magnitude.
This supports the interpretation that the ignition effect arises from information-geometric alignment rather than stochastic fluctuation.


\section{Related Concepts}
HysteroGrad differs from natural-gradient methods such as K-FAC or Shampoo by introducing a history-dependent hysteretic gating mechanism. Unlike SAM or sharpness-aware methods, the barrier operates in information space rather than loss space and enforces irreversible stiffening along frequently traversed directions.

\section{Discussion of Physical Phenomena}
The observed "Geometric Ignition" (the rapid surge in accuracy after metric stabilization) suggests that the Fisher Information Matrix $G$ acts as a catalyst. Once the local geometry is "mapped" into $G$, the Natural Gradient updates align perfectly with the geodesic paths to the loss minima, overcoming the initial stochastic noise.

\section{Conclusion}
HysteroGrad demonstrates that the integration of hysteretic barriers into information-geometric optimization provides a robust defense against noise and catastrophic forgetting, significantly optimizing the compute-to-accuracy ratio.
